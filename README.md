## Credits

This project was inspired and based on the tutorial "Account Abstraction Practical: Send UserOperations with Alchemy!" by CryptoSheinix. You can watch the video tutorial at this [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sV5Yzfsivk&ab_channel=CryptoSheinix).

Also, Alchemy's official guide to account abstraction was an invaluable reference. You can find it [here](https://www.alchemy.com/blog/account-abstraction).
